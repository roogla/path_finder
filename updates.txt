U1.) -- updated
    # decision scoring improvements
    # logic currently decides based on lowest score index
    # score is calculated as:
    # [is_wall] + [distance_to_goal] + [past]
    # if [distance_to_goal} < 22 pixels set obj['cost'] = -1
    # *see B2*
    # want to score adjacent rects on creation of wall
B3.U1) - managed to implement cost decision addition
       - but have managed to create new calculation bugs

B4)
    # certain rects are created as walls
    # but assigned in correct fill
    # fill 1 creates border
    # fill 0 fills entirely

U2.) -- fixed
    # issue in path.py
    # function square_detection calls function change_list
    # all functionality can be moved to one or the other

B2.) --- fixed
    # Traceback (most recent call last):
    #  File "C:\Users\glass\Documents\aoc\path_finder\path_pygame.py", line 106, in <module>
    #    point_holder[0] = find_nine(point_holder[0], rect_list, point_holder)

    # checks() definition -> "box_x": dict key is hard coded to grid
    # object current_list[x]. Where x represents a grib object that
    # DNE along the edge of the search path.

    >>> for checks dict in grid.py updated key "box_seven" to grab second to last
        list object from current_list instead of object hard-coding position.

B1.) --- fixed
    # current_pos object will bounce off target instead of choosing
    # target pos as cheapest option.
